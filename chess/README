main method in Board class

+ first uploaded draft of chess GUI
+ need more efficiency in paint methods -- takes too long to load
	- has been improved on but can still use more work, 
	  especially w respect to image sizes
+ GUI does not yet work the way it should:
	- framework is there
	- must make each SquarePanel a MouseListener and 
	  connect 8x8 SquarePanel array to array of pieces 
	  (also 8x8, initially with 16 non-null Piece objects) so pieces can move
+ working on sizing GUI to appropriate size of screens
	- using Toolkit to get user's screen dimension
	- working from there using GridBagLayout to improve functionality and appearance
	- possibly implement a few different standard sizes based on different
	  standard screen sizes to avoid having to resize piece images
